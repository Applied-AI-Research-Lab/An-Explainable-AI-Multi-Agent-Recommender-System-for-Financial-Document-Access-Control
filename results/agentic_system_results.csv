Recommendation:  
Two of the three specialist agents classified the text as Internal, but their confidence is relatively low to moderate (45.68% and 64.25%), while the GPT-4.1-mini-FT model strongly classifies it as Public with very high confidence (90%). The content itself describes a generic financing structure (a EUR40m market-based loan from Standard Chartered Bank Hong Kong) with no indication that this is an undisclosed deal, insider information, or material non‑public event; such financing details are commonly disclosed in public announcements and financial reports.

Given:
- The relatively weak majority (no high-confidence consensus for Internal),
- The very strong confidence for Public from a fine‑tuned model,
- And the nature of the text (standard transactional financing description with no explicit signals of confidentiality or material non‑public information),

it is appropriate to favor the Public classification.

This text can be treated as suitable for external sharing and inclusion in public documents (e.g., press releases, investor presentations, or public filings), provided it accurately reflects the actual terms and no separate contractual or regulatory restrictions on disclosure exist. No special access controls are required beyond normal publication governance.",True
